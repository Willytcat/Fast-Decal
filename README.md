# Fast-Decal ?

Tired of having to struggle to texture paint images on mesh materials, and having to take 3 years to create a node node?

# WTF is FD ?

Fast Decal is a blender addon that create nodes groups to paste any texture on an object with a material, and after placing it you still can move it !

FD is pretty easy to use, just choose your image inputs, select any object(s) (with a texture), click on New Decal, it'll creates an empty wich project your texture on the textures of the selected object(s) (it snaps on the surface automaticly). After that you can still change the images, and the node group in the shader editor, the addon have also have an edit interface where you can directly change a bunch of the node group parameters.

# Why FD ?

Because im not a rich guy like the ones who buyed Stamp It : https://blendermarket.com/products/easy-decal--stamp (-> FD better). Seriously theres a tutorial online to create the node group in question, and it is selled for 17.75 bucks !
