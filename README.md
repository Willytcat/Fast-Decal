# Fast-Decal

Tired of having to struggle to texture paint images on mesh materials, and having to take 3 years to create a node node?

# WTF is FD ?

Fast Decal is a blender addon that create nodes groups to paste any texture on an object with a material, and after placing it you still can move it !

FD is pretty easy to use, just choose your image inputs, select an object (with a texture), click on New Decal, it'll creates an empty wich project your texture on the textures of the selected objects (it snaps on the surface automaticly)
